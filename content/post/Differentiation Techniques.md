# Differentiation Techniques
differentiation is a method of finding the derivative of a function.

Here are the most common differentiation rules with examples for each rule. These rules form the core toolbox for tackling derivatives in calculus.

## 1. Constant Rule
__Rule:__ The derivative of a constant is always 0

__Example:__

if $f(x) = 7 $, then $$ f`(x) = 0 $$

## 2. Power Rule
__Rule:__ For any function $f(x) = x^n$ where $n$ is any real number), the derivative is $$ f`(x) = nx^{n-1} $$

__Example:__

if $f(x) = x^4$, then $$ f`(x) = 4x^3 $$

if $f(x) = 3x^3$, then 

$$ f\`(x) = 3 \times 3x^{3-1} $$
$$ f\`(x) = 9x^2 $$

## Product Rule
__Rule:__ For the product of two functions, if $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, then $$ f\`(x) = g(x)h\`(x) + h(x)\`g(x) $$

> In words: first times the derivative of second plus second time the derivative of first

__Example:__

let $g(x) = x^2$ and $h(x) = 5x^3$ so that $$ f(x) = x^2 5x $$
